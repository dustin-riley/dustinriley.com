Hey there, I'm Dustin! ðŸ‘‹ I'm an engineering manager at Vanta, where I help build awesome teams that love to experiment, innovate, and have fun along the way.

I've had some great adventures at Elation Health, Automox, and Eli Lillyâ€”shaking up strategies, scaling teams, and swapping monoliths for microservices. I've even dabbled in freelance work, cooking up everything from financial apps to AI-driven tools.

I studied computer science at Miami University and picked up some Agile and ITIL skills along the way. This blog is where I share my thoughts (and occasional rants!) on tech management, team building, agile practices, and all the fun, messy stuff in between.

Glad you're hereâ€”grab a coffee and stick around!
